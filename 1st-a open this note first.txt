if you dont want to run VsCode in order to access the api follow this:

*open build.bat first wait for it to close.

*open run.bat

NOTE: make sure you have java runtime and maven

java: https://download.oracle.com/java/21/archive/jdk-21.0.1_windows-x64_bin.msi

maven: https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.8/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.8-bin.zip

after using the api, you can delete the folder named "target" to free up space
